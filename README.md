Role Assignment BOT

This bot has been created as a project I've to submit at uni.

Although being just a project bot, this bot is able to do the dedicated task of assigning and unassigning a role to a user with ease.


Wanting to add a little more, the bot also greets when a user joins or leaves the server.

There is also one more commmand which goes by 'hello'. The bot replies to you when the command is run.
