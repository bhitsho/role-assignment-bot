Role Assignment BOT

This bot has been created as a project I've to submit at uni.

Although being just a project bot, this bot is able to do the dedicated task of assigning and unassigning a role to a user with ease.


Wanting to add a little more, the bot also greets when a user joins or leaves the server.

There is also one more commmand which goes by 'hello'. The bot replies to you when the command is run.



The bot is coded in Python language using the Discord and other libraries. I wanted to do it in JS but I'm not much familiar with the language and still learning it.
The architecture used is kind of MVC as it does seperate the main code and the codes of commands and functions it does.
